Bitcoin rely heavily on a match object called elliptic curve, without this math structure bitcoin will like a castle on beach, it will collapse in any time.What is 
ellipitic curve, its a equation like this: y^2 = x^3 + ax +b, and its shape just like following:

for bitcoin, its elliptic curve has a name: secp256k1 and its equation is y^2 = x ^ 3 + 7
